This is a Freeway type of game. This one, particularly, has a halloween thematic. 

The original idea came from an Alura's p5.js course, in which we had to make a way simpler game. 

My touches were:

•	The halloween concept and its design

•	Different game rules (win and game over)

•	A break at the game dynamics, stopping it briefly when you score or die

•	Adding an end to the game either you win or lose.


Other modifications:

•	The game screen size was increased

•	The game screen was set a central element in the browser screen

•	Changed the loading screen (before it was only a “Loading…” text in a white background)

•	The background outside the game screen was changed to black, to match the game thematic 


Several other code implementations and refactoring were made in order to simplify some functions, made the game work in that halloween design and, of course, served to a nice way to put into practice the things I have learned in other courses of logic programming.

The design, sound track and sound effects:

•	The design was created by myself

•	Although I have not drawn any of the elements, I have searched for each one and, in some cases, modified its colors, sizes, shapes, etc.

•	In order to make the job done in a shorter time, I decided to use the Canva online application and mix some of elements and figures that already exists in it with images I have found in internet.

•	The sound tracks were found on their creator’s pages:

	o	Spook by PeriTune (https://soundcloud.com/sei_peridot/spook) - Stage Song

	o	Something Wicked by Ross Bugden (https://www.youtube.com/c/RossBugden) - Game Over Song

	o	Spooky Ride by Twin Musicom (twinmusicom.org) - Victory Song

•	The sound effects were ripped of other free sources which do not specify the authors

This game has no intention to be a commercial project, earn profits or even be a free download for entertainment. It’s a student project made with the only purpose of learn stuff. However, if you own any of these materials and don’t wanna see them here, please, keep in touch with me and I will remove it from the project.
